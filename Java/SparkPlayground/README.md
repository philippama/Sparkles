This is a Java sub-project to try out the Spark Java API. There is a noddy Spark application embedded within it at pm.spark.playground.Playground but most of the experimentation has been done in small bites as unit tests.

The application is basically SimpleApp from http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html#self-contained-applications but with master configured in code.
